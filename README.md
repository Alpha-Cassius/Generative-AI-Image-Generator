# Generative-AI-Image-Generator
---

### Code Description üßë‚Äçüíª

The project is built using **Python** and leverages the **CustomTkinter** library for a modern and customizable GUI. It interacts with the **Hugging Face API** to generate images based on text prompts. Below is an overview of the key components of the code:

1. **Libraries and JSON Setup**:  
   The code imports essential libraries like `customtkinter` for GUI creation, `requests` for API interaction, and `PIL` (Pillow) for image manipulation. It also reads a JSON file (`IMG_GENERATION_MODELS.json`) that contains model names and their respective API URLs for dynamic model selection.

2. **App Class Initialization**:  
   The `App` class inherits from `CTk` and serves as the main window for the application. Upon initialization, the app configures a sleek black-themed window and places various elements like labels, text boxes, and buttons.

3. **User Interface**:  
   - **Prompt Entry**: A multi-line text box where the user inputs the text prompt for image generation.
   - **Model Selection**: A combo box that allows the user to select different AI models for image generation, dynamically updating the API URL.
   - **Generate and Save Buttons**: The generate button sends the prompt to the Hugging Face model via an API call, while the save button allows the user to save the generated image.

4. **Image Generation**:  
   The `generate` function sends a POST request with the user‚Äôs prompt to the selected AI model API. Upon receiving the generated image, it resizes it to fit within the display area and updates the app window with the image.

5. **Save Functionality**:  
   The `save_image` function allows users to save the generated image locally in `.png` or `.jpg` formats using a file dialog.

6. **Model Selection**:  
   The `change_model` function dynamically changes the API URL based on the selected model, enabling flexibility in generating different types of artwork.
